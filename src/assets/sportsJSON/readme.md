# Sports JSON
> JSON lists of sports with division, teams, abbreviations, mascot, and logo

I created this for another project but I didn't want to deal with an API. I thought other people would want a quick and easy way to get important bits of information about teams.
If you have a list you would like to contribute then feel free to send me a pull request and I'll add it to the list.
Ironically I'm not a big mainstream sports fan so I won't be actively keeping this up to date but if you create an issue pointing out any changes then I will gladly change them.

## JSON Format

```
division
├─team
│ ├─abbreviation
│ ├─mascot
│ └─path/to/logo
├─team
│ ├─abbreviation
│ ├─mascot

├─etc...
```
